Wow. 2019 an incredibly busy, incredibly productive year. So how'd we do?


# Design Systems, Web Components, and Front-end Architecture

If you <a href="https://twitter.com/salem_ghoweri">follow me on Twitter</a> (or know me personally) then you already know that I'm a lead front-end architect who's a crazy HUGE fan of design systems and web components! Naturally it shouldn't come as a surprise then that my last past couple years have been filled to the brim with that stuff -- and 2019 was no exception!

## Section Header

Capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.

``` text/2-3
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
